YOLOv8 Coin Detection
Welcome to the YOLOv8 Coin Detection repository! This project utilizes YOLOv8, a powerful object detection model, to accurately identify and classify coins in images and videos.

Dataset
I trained our model using a comprehensive dataset of coins, which you can access here. This diverse dataset includes various coin types, denominations, and orientations, ensuring robust performance in different scenarios.

Model Training
To train the YOLOv8 model, follow these steps:

Set the current working directory:

bash
Copy code
%cd {os.getcwd()}
Train the YOLOv8 model using the provided dataset:

bash
Copy code
!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data={dataset.location}/data.yaml epochs=50 plots=True
Adjust the parameters as needed based on your dataset and training requirements.

Usage
Integrate the trained YOLOv8 Coin Detection model into your projects effortlessly. Use the provided weights (yolov8s.pt) for accurate coin recognition. The model is versatile and can adapt to various lighting conditions, backgrounds, and coin placements within the frame.

Results
Check the plots directory for visualizations of the training process, helping you assess the model's performance. Feel free to customize and fine-tune the training parameters for optimal results.
